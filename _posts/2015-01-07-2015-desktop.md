I took the opportunity of the new year to give my programming environments a fresh look and try out some new things. Check it out:

## zsh

I've tried a few times before, but I'm making a real attempt to ditch bash and give [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) a try this year. Some cool things so far:

* I set `REPORTTIME=2` which will automatically output how long a command took if it took more than 2 seconds (this is awesome! I used to try to prepend `time` unless of course when I forgot and I wished I did!)
* [zsh-git-prompt](https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt) for useful indicators for git repos (current branch, changed files, etc.)

I'm using a fairly minimal config, eschewing oh-my-zsh and whatnot as I learn more about "stock" zsh. Follow along with [my config files on GitHub](https://github.com/willcodeforfoo/dotfiles).

## Dark Theme

For the past couple years, I've used a light theme for Sublime Text. I've decided to try a [darker theme](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) hoping it'll reduce eye strain when staring at code for long hours.

## Menubar Apps

For reference, here's whats currently up in my menubar.

* Twitter - I still use the official Twitter client. I don't love it, but don't use it enough to look for any non-obvious replacements
* Dropbox
* TextExpander
* 1Password
* Freckle - New timer app, helps me keep track of hours for billing
* Degrees - Weather
* Plex - Media center
* CCMenu - (Almost) real-time status of various CI builds (Drone, Jenkins, and Travis CI)
* Fantastical - Quick viewing and entry of calendar items
* [Visitors](http://www.mediaatelier.com/Visitors/) - Real-time gauge of how many people are on a site, powered by Google Analytics
* [Usage](http://www.mediaatelier.com/Usage/?lang=en) - Lightweight way tokeep track of how much time you spend in various apps
* Creative Cloud - I have the [Photography plan](https://creative.adobe.com/plans/photography), $10 a month for Photoshop and Lightroom
