> "Notes" posts are my free-form reactions to podcasts, books, movies, TV and other media. They may be a mixture of summaries and my own insights and thoughts.

* Small, composable
* Pragmatism / Minimalism
* Designed by consensus of 3 people
* Not "language designers" - but programmers
* Splash Keynote Problems at Google with 10 million lines of C++ (http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article)
* Started as systems langauge
* Plan 9: Never caught on, ideas still relevant
* Andrew: Go glob, community (HN), release binaries
* Google imports OOS, not vice-versa - no GOOG branding anywhere
* Go designed for lots of code, large environments
* Right palette of tools for systems vs. python
* Not all can be replaced with Go: LoC, latency (GC)
* No Makefiles or metadata, don't need complex build system
* In Google, used:
  * YouTube MySQL "proxy"/load balancer
  * dl.google.com (talks on talks.golang.org)
  * groupcache
* contemporary stdlib solves modern problems (e.g., JSON)
* Webserver in 10 LoC
* Goal: Keep language in head, 50 pg. spec
* Productive in a weekend
* tour.golang.org
* 1.2: Focus on more tools that understand go code)
  * December 1, 2013
