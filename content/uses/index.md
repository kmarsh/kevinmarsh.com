I use a 2020 13" M1 MacBook Pro as my primary computer. It has been quite amazing, even given the fact it's a bit before its time with regard to compatability.

It's almost always plugged into a [Dell P2715Q](https://www.dell.com/is/business/p/dell-p2715q-monitor/pd) 27" LCD monitor which, despite not having any USB-C ports, I've liked a lot.

I use a wired Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad via USB. I have a mechanical keyboard that fell out of use when I was working in an office with others and should get back into, but it's not up to the standards of the enthusiasts I follow. I even have an IBM Model M and an Apple Extended II that I love the feel of, but their age makes getting them connected quite a hassle.

I use a Apple Magic Mouse 2, which I just upgraded to from an Magic Mouse that I've had for years. I know many mock it, but I like it a lot. I tried a Logitech MX Master but couldn't get used to the ergonomics.

# Development

I've used Visual Studio Code for all development since around 2017. Previously I used Sublime Text and TextMate heavily, and have given vim more honest tries than I can count.

I don't use many of its advanced features, but have made a commitment to use the built in terminal and git integration more and it's been pretty good!

I'm a sucker for the [Ocean Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kleber-swf.ocean-dark-extended) theme and I've made variations for Terminal.app as well. I've taken cues from the colors for this site as well.

I use the [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) font from Adobe which is free and open source.

# Office

In the Summer of 2020 I remodeled our small detached garage into an office I call The Shedquarters. It's around 200 sq. ft.

I use a Herman Miller Mirra chair that I bought in 2010 and has served me well for hours a day ever since, they've even sent someone to my home to fix a cracked back free of charge!

My desk is a [Jarvis standing desk by Fully](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html) that I don't take advanage of enough throughout the day and wish was bigger.

I have way more notebooks than I could ever use, and am somehow always buying more. I typically keep a notepad open on my desk, usually a [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/pitch-black-memo-book) or a [Rhodia spiral bound pad](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_spiral_A5.php). Dot grid, please.

I have a Canon Pro-100 inkjet printer that can print beautiful 13x19" prints that, if it weren't for [Precision Colors](https://www.precisioncolors.com) inks, would be more far more expensive than just going to a lab. [Red River Paper](https://www.redrivercatalog.com) makes awesome stocks in lots of different sizes.

I try and scan every piece of paper that comes my way with a [Fuji ScanSnap S1500M](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/scansnap/discontinued/s1500m/s1500m.html). Big props to them for continuing to support it through new releases of macOS!

# Phone

I use an iPhone Pro 11. I've owned pretty much all the iPhones, starting with the original back in 2007. I've felt the need to upgrade less as time goes on: maybe the differences are becoming less and less noticible or maybe I'm just getting older. I love it and wish I didn't glance at it so much.

## Apps

Some of the apps I use on a regular basis.

* **1Password** (macOS, iOS): I try to do the right thing and use random password for everything.
* **Plex** (Everywhere): I run a Plex Media Server on my Synology and stream TV and Movies to almost any device.
* **Reeder** (iOS, Mac): The best app to comsume RSS feeds, used with [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com)
* **Adobe Lightroom** (macOS): While I don't use it much these days, all my photos pre-2019 or so are here. Since shooting mostly with my iPhone, importing became too cumbersome compared to iCloud and Google Photos so it's mostly an archive of the past. I still use the Classic version because, as of very recently, the cloud one still didn't support printing(!)
* **AnyList** (iOS): Sharing grocery lists and recipes with the wife has never been easier, especially with Alexa and Google Home integration ("Alexa, add beer to the grocery list.")
* **Apollo** (iOS): Much better than new Reddit.
* **Chrome** (macOS): Occasionally need to fire it up for the dev tools, which are top-notch.
* **Drafts** (iOS): I should use this more.
* **Dropbox** (macOS, iOS): I've never paid for it or used any of it's. I have 6GB+ or so of free usage from referrals back in the day and it's good enough for what it does. Keeps a bunch of folders in sync and backed up across devices.
* **Fantastical** (iOS): I only use this on my iPhone.
* **GoodReader** (iOS): The best app I've found for consuming PDFs on the iPad.
* **Google Photos** (iOS, Web): The search is amazing and I love seeing photos on our Google Nest Hub in the kitchen. It's alos nice to have (another) automated backup. I use their API for creating a photo calendar for my wife's Christmas present every year.
* **Safari**: For performance, privacy, and battery life I've recently switched to Safari from Chrome as my daily driver.
* **Snapseed** (iOS): For quick editing of photos before sharing
* **Spark:** The best native email client I've come across for several Google-hosted email accounts. Used on macOS and iOS.
* **Spotify:** I've been a user since you had to use a proxy server in the US. Their music discovery has gotten so good.
* **TablePlus:** For connecting to PostgreSQL database servers (or any) with a decent GUI. Replaced Sequel Pro.
* **TickTick:** Giving this a go for task management. I gave OmniFocus a bunch of money over the years but it never stuck.
* **Tweetbot:** As much as I'd like to avoid Twitter, I keep coming back.

# Photography

Back when I had more free time I loved to shoot with a _real_ camera. You know, setting up flashes, changing lenses, and so on. But nowadays most of my photos are taken with an iPhone. I upgraded a few times but I currently have a [Canon T2i](https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/eos-rebel-t2i-body) with a bunch of lenses.

I grew up [posting to Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarsh/) for the world to see, but now most photos are private and stored in Apple and Google Photos.
