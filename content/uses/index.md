I use a 2020 13" M1 MacBook Pro as my primary computer. It has been quite amazing, even given the fact it's a bit before its time with regard to compatability.

It's almost always plugged into a [Dell P2715Q](https://www.dell.com/is/business/p/dell-p2715q-monitor/pd) 27" LCD monitor which, despite not having any USB-C ports, I've liked a lot.

I use a wired Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad via USB. I have a mechanical keyboard that fell out of use when I was working in an office with others and should get back into, but it's not up to the standards of the enthusiasts I follow. I even have an IBM Model M and an Apple Extended II that I love the feel of, but their age makes getting them connected quite a hassle.

I use a Apple Magic Mouse 2, which I just upgraded to from an Magic Mouse that I've had for years. I know many mock it, but I like it a lot. I tried a Logitech MX Master but couldn't get used to the ergonomics.

# Development

I've used Visual Studio Code for all development since around 2017. Previously I used Sublime Text and TextMate heavily, and have given vim more honest tries than I can count.

I don't use much of its advanced features, but have made a commitment to use the built in terminal and git integration more and it's been pretty good!

I'm a sucker for the [Ocean Dark theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kleber-swf.ocean-dark-extended) and I've made variations for Terminal.app as well. I've taken queues from the colors for this site as well.

I use the Source Code Pro font.

# Mobile

I use an iPhone Pro 11. I've owned pretty much all the iPhones, starting with the original back in 2007. I've felt the need to upgrade. It seems like the differences are becoming less and less noticible, but maybe I'm just getting older.

## Apps

Some of the apps I use on a regular basis.

* 1Password
* Adobe Lightroom: While I don't use it much these days, all my photos pre 2019 or so are here. Since shooting mostly with my iPhone, importing became too cumbersome compared to iCloud and Google Photos so it's mostly an archive of the past.
* AnyList
* Apollo
* Chrome: Occasionally need to fire it up for the dev tools, which are top-notch.
* Deliveries
* Drafts
* Dropbox: I've never paid for it or used any of it's. I have 6GB+ or so of free usage from referrals back in the day and it's good enough for what it does. Keeps a bunch of folders in sync and backed up across devices.
* Fantastical
* GoodReader
* Google Photos: The search is amazing and I love seeing photos on our Google Nest Hub in the kitchen. It's nice to have an automated backup.
* Instagram
* Instapaper
* Plex
* Reeder
* Safari: For performance, privacy, and battery life I've recently switched to Safari from Chrome as my daily driver.
* Slack
* Snapseed
* Sonos
* Soulver
* Spark: The best native email client I've come across for several Google-hosted email accounts. Used on macOS and iOS.
* Spotify
* Swarm
* TablePlus
* TickTick
* Tweetbot
* VLC
* Zoom
