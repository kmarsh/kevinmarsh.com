Happy April Fools! (No tricks here.) There have been a lot of links since the [last post](/2015/04/24/friday-link-review.html), so I thought I'd just include the ones since the beginning of March:

* [Tesla Model 3](https://www.teslamotors.com/model3) - I want one. Windshield/roof is a single piece of glass. 215 mile range, 0-60 in < 6 seconds. Starting at $35K. Starts shipping late 2017. 115K people pre-ordered/deposited $1K before it was even announced.
* [Caravel](https://github.com/airbnb/caravel) - New interactive data exploration platform recently open-sourced by Airbnb. Looks to be a worthy competitor of Tableau Server
* [Metabase](http://www.metabase.com/) - Another open source data explorer I learned about through the Caravel Hacker News story's comments
* [Canvas](https://usecanvas.com/) - Collaborative Markdown-like editor
* [Deis Workflow, now in Beta!](https://deis.com/blog/2016/deis-workflow-beta/) - Seems they are pivoting to work more with Kubernetes
* [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) - Noticed these when I installed the latest update to [CCMenu](http://ccmenu.org/). Very crisp.
* [Pixave - The smartest way to organize your images](http://www.littlehj.com/)
* [We Can Cut This Out](http://wecancutthisout.com/) - Not sure if still updated, but someone has spent a bunch of time cataloging [ROTL](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/) episodes
* [Use the Unofficial Bash Strict Mode (Unless You Looove Debugging)](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/)
* [NPR decides it won’t promote its podcasts or NPR One on air](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/npr-decides-it-wont-promote-its-podcasts-or-npr-one-on-air/) - Another example of the old guard trying to preserve its position at the expense of its (technically superior) replacement
* [Runnable](https://runnable.io/) - Full stack testing environments for your app, per branch
* [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) - "Automatically track TV & movies you're watching."
* [LEGO Brick Labels – The Brick Architect](http://brickarchitect.com/labels/) - I bought a [Brother PT-P700 from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Brother-PT-P700-Connectable-Label-Maker/dp/B00DSYEB28/) for $40 to make these.
* [Ansible vs Chef](http://tjheeta.github.io/2015/04/15/ansible-vs-chef/) - Good review of Ansible and how it's different than Chef. (I love Ansible BTW)
* [FLIF - Free Lossless Image Format](http://flif.info/index.html)
* [Pimpmykeyboard.com](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/) - Really need to pick a mechanical keyboard soon
* [Now Playing on Sirius Satellite Radio](http://www.dogstarradio.com/now_playing.php) - They also have historical data about tracks played on Sirius. Future basis for a Sirius/Spotify playlist generator?
