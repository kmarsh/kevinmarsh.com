I've always been curious how many times certain songs are played on mainstream radio. Sometimes it seems like the same song is played every hour, or every time I get back in the car during a trip. So, a few years ago (actually, during the pandemic) I started crawling the Now Playing sections of thousands of radio websites and have started tabulating the results and building a site to explore them.

I present [overplayed.app](https://overplayed.app):

I can envision a ton of ways to present this data, but I started with a simple daily summary of the top songs played across the US and Canada, currently about 2,500 stations. I hope you'll find it interesting and, if you're curious like I am, will keep checking back for new features as I have a ton more I'd like to do with the site.
