Today I learned you can insert __image cells__ into a Google Sheets document. All you need is a URL to an image:

```
=IMAGE("http://example.com/image.jpg")
```

The [documentation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093333/?hl=en&authuser=0) lists a few other options, like how the image should be sized and fit the cell.

For certain things, like planning a kitchen remodel, having a small thumbnail makes it really easy to skim through a document and even helps in the design process.
